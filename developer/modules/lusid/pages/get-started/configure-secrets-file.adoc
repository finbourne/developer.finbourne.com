:page-pagination: true

In this guide you'll learn how to create a secrets file for use with the LUSID API and xref:languages/index.adoc[LUSID SDKs].

[NOTE]
====
You'll need to have created a LUSID application before following the instructions in this guide.
If you haven't yet created an application, see xref:get-started/create-application.adoc[].
====

From the LUSID home page, navigate to the Applications page.
To do this, click on the person icon on the left hand menu and then click on the `Applications` link:

.Open the application

Once you're on this page, click on the eye icon. 
You'll see the following screen: 

.Application credentials
image::secrets-part-1.png[]

Now you'll need to create a JSON file based on these values.

.secrets.json
[source, json]

    "clientSecret": "<4>",
    "applicationName": "<applicationName>",
    "username": "<username>",
    "password": "<password>"
  }
}
